ROMAN TO INTEGER

roman numerals normally written left to right, largest to smallest order
7 symbols - I V X L C D M

if adding smaller value after the larger -
then substracting it
cant put multiple smaller values before larger


ex IM <- -1 and 1000 = 999


ex 2 :

CMXCVIII

is there a bigger value after it? then it's negative
C < M then -100
M > X then +1000
X < C then -10
C > V then +100
V > I then +5
I = I then +1
I = I then +1
I = I then +1

 = 998
